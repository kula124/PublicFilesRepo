1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,029
Facebook, Google and Amazon
exploit our data for profit.

2
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,014
I will help you by building
an internet of the people

3
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,748
by the people and for the people,

4
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:05,823
so help me God.

5
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:10,314
You said all that stuff about
not collecting user data.

6
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:12,404
- But I am.
- I just lied to Congress.

7
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:14,564
Hooli will remain an independent entity,

8
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:16,864
even if we have to shed a few divisions

9
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:18,445
and trim a little fat.

10
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,664
Gwart has a really good idea,

11
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,744
but she doesn't have a business plan.

12
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:24,785
Hi, I'm Jared.

13
00:00:26,085 --> 00:00:28,954
We were able to break
down all of your misdeeds.

14
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:31,294
This guy is dirty as
a dog, and we got him.

15
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,464
Oh, hell yes.

16
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,844
It's the greatest data
aggregating platform.

17
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,715
And Richard developed
it specifically for us.

18
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,660
- Synced and corrected by<font color="#00BFFF"> Firefly</font> -
- <font color="#00ffff">www.addic7ed.com</font> -

19
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:47,435
So this morning, Colin cut a new build

20
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:49,606
of Gates of Galloo
to his staging server.

21
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:53,814
Okay, um, this is Baldereach,

22
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:55,444
capital city of Galloonia.

23
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:58,114
Those are some ghoul knights,
wearing gelatinous armor.

24
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,114
This is just the game,
pretty standard stuff.

25
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:02,074
Well, until I...

26
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:03,664
turn on the microphone.

27
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:05,744
How are you doing,
Richard? Are you hungry?

28
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:08,995
Would you like some pizza?

29
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:12,964
What the fuck?

30
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:16,594
He's using our API to run ads
directly in the game engine?

31
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:18,044
Crazy, right?

32
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,554
Domino's Pizza

33
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,724
in a fantasy medieval universe.

34
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:24,185
Why, it's enough to make
you wanna go on vacation.

35
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:28,224
And he's even using
our ability to track sentiment.

36
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,024
Yeah. Even if I say nonsense words,

37
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,894
it assigns them an emotional value.

38
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:34,355
La-la-la-la-la-la-la!

39
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,274
Fuck me. So,

40
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,274
unless we get rid of
Colin, which we can't,

41
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:41,785
he is going to put this on our network.

42
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:44,864
Money just perverts everything.

43
00:01:44,865 --> 00:01:47,454
At this point, I could stand
to be a little perverted.

44
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:49,452
Yeah, I wanna be a lot perverted.

45
00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:52,454
I wanna blow money while it
talks to its wife on the phone.

46
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:54,422
- I wanna suck money... Oh.
- All right.

47
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,356
- Microphone.
- Oh! Uh...

48
00:01:56,357 --> 00:01:58,674
Kittens, puppies, United Nations!

49
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:07,869
<font color="#a4290b">♪ Silicon Valley 6x02 ♪</font>
<font color="#cb4b4b">Blood Money</font>

50
00:02:10,685 --> 00:02:13,395
Richard, is this an okay time?

51
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:16,564
It's a great time, Jared.

52
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,155
I'm surrounded on all sides
by people who turn on me.

53
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:24,244
- I can come back.
- No. No, no, it's fine.

54
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,365
What do you got?

55
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,874
What is this?

56
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,415
It's my resignation letter.

57
00:02:36,045 --> 00:02:38,045
I'm leaving.

58
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:40,045
What?

59
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:45,424
One gaff with Colin, and
you're just gonna walk away?

60
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,304
It's about so much
more than that, Richard.

61
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:49,344
I've been agonizing over this.

62
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,474
Not sleeping, not eating...

63
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:55,774
I completely forgot my
godson's 40th birthday.

64
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,104
Richard,

65
00:02:57,105 --> 00:03:00,404
Pied Piper isn't the same
company that I signed up for.

66
00:03:00,405 --> 00:03:02,734
She has different needs now,

67
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:04,484
and so do you,

68
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,115
and, it turns out,

69
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,455
so do I.

70
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,744
Okay, Jared...

71
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:14,584
we are in the middle
of a shit storm here.

72
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,754
I'm trying to handle this
as honestly as possible.

73
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:20,084
There's a founder at the hacker hostel,

74
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,424
and she needs my help, and...

75
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:24,254
once I'm free of encumbrances...

76
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:26,594
Encumbrances?! Oh! Well,

77
00:03:26,595 --> 00:03:29,634
fuck me, Jared. I don't
want to encumber you.

78
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,684
Okay.

79
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:34,814
Go to your new boss.
I hope she's not a...

80
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,524
big of a fuck-up as I am, you...

81
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:38,695
buddy-fucker.

82
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,774
- I'm not a buddy-fucker.
- Oh, yes, you are, Jared.

83
00:03:42,775 --> 00:03:44,614
You are a buddy-fucker.

84
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,194
I am your buddy,

85
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:48,454
and you are fucking me. Ergo,

86
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,455
you are a buddy-fucker.

87
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,245
Goodbye.

88
00:03:57,665 --> 00:04:00,755
- Richard, I'm not...
- Goodbye, Jared. Thank you.

89
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:10,305
I like it how it is.

90
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:12,144
But it's too warm.

91
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,935
I want it warm.

92
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:17,315
Okay.

93
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:23,984
Gentlemen, and lady,

94
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:26,274
a short time ago, I reached
out to you and asked you

95
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,074
to invest, sight unseen, in a newer,

96
00:04:29,075 --> 00:04:31,324
leaner, and more focused Hooli.

97
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:33,994
And invest you did, guided not by

98
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,704
traditional spreadsheets
or actuarial tables,

99
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:38,954
but by your own highly
attuned financial...

100
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:41,334
Gavin, cut the bullshit.

101
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,130
What do we still own?

102
00:04:43,131 --> 00:04:44,504
Mr. Skelton.

103
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,504
As candid and as forthright as ever.

104
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:49,514
- Age has not dulled one iota of...
- Gavin.

105
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:52,434
Of course. I had
prepared a presentation,

106
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:54,344
but I suppose I can
just skip to the end.

107
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,554
Hopefully, I won't lose you.

108
00:04:56,555 --> 00:04:58,685
Okay...

109
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:02,194
Confucius, John Lennon,

110
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,604
Nietzsche, Ayn Rand,

111
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,444
Steve Wonder, and here we go!

112
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:07,694
As you can see,

113
00:05:07,695 --> 00:05:10,574
among the many jewels
still in Hooli's crown

114
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:13,914
are our exciting suite of office...

115
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,324
Where is web services?

116
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:19,794
Well, Mr. Bezos felt it would
fold nicely into his AWS,

117
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:20,874
so he insisted...

118
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,044
Smart speaker and in-home?

119
00:05:23,045 --> 00:05:26,584
- He took that, too?
- HooliHome was, indeed, subsumed

120
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,844
- by the Amazon Alexa...
- Targeted search?

121
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:31,215
Ironically, also missing.

122
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,094
But we maintain rights to the HooliPhone

123
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:35,304
and its proprietary apps,

124
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:38,434
the patent for the Hooli Puck Mouse.

125
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:41,184
We also maintain our
web-based marketplaces,

126
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:45,154
including our up-and-coming
lifestyle networking platform,

127
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:48,444
- Foxhole.
- What the fuck is that?!

128
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:51,784
Well, Foxhole is a very exciting

129
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,074
web-based exchange, catering
to those in the military,

130
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:56,640
who are interested in having

131
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:59,274
- extramarital affairs.
- Gavin,

132
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:02,124
when do you expect the eight of us will

133
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:04,294
recoup our investment?

134
00:06:04,295 --> 00:06:06,924
Ah, yes! That's my very next slide.

135
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,795
After this one.

136
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,174
Well, with a little luck,

137
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:16,264
we'll be profitable and
up 5X inside three years.

138
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,765
You got three months, or you're out.

139
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,774
So, Melanie will take on all of Jared's

140
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,814
marketing duties, Gwen
will cover biz dev,

141
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:28,234
and that should take care of it.

142
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,484
Does this scan to you?

143
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:31,444
- I can see it.
- Okay, great.

144
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,244
- Okay, back to work.
- Uh, Bertram,

145
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:36,245
while I have you...

146
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,704
You don't have me.

147
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:41,664
Richard's just tasked me
with streamlining productivity

148
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,124
and balancing headcount.

149
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,954
Can you explain to me why you have

150
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:46,794
no one working under you?

151
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:50,044
It just seems odd considering
that the agile board is showing

152
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,004
that you have a massive backlog.

153
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,594
You're new here,

154
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:56,384
so I'll forgive the patronizing tone.

155
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:58,804
I'm more concerned with being right

156
00:06:58,805 --> 00:07:00,644
than being fast,

157
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:04,314
and I don't like dealing
with people. To wit,

158
00:07:04,315 --> 00:07:06,434
- are we done?
- Oh,

159
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:07,774
you're "that guy".

160
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,904
What "guy" exactly?

161
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:12,274
The brooding, arrogant guy

162
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,574
who refuses to take orders?

163
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,508
Self-taught coder who looks down on

164
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,074
anyone who's taken a class.

165
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:19,954
You're probably an atheist

166
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,164
or something more contrarian.

167
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,704
You claim to be an anarcho-capitalist,

168
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:26,874
but you work here and pay taxes.

169
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,328
You've probably read

170
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:30,920
half of Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon,

171
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:34,054
and it's about 50/50
whether you own a snake.

172
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,924
His girlfriend owns a snake.

173
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,634
I finished Cryptonomicon,

174
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:41,554
and you easily could've
just looked in my file.

175
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,054
I didn't need to.

176
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:46,144
- I'm assigning you five coders.
- Inadvisable.

177
00:07:46,145 --> 00:07:47,564
Noted.

178
00:07:47,565 --> 00:07:49,314
I'll send them over
first thing tomorrow.

179
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,841
If you're going to throw
five randoms under me,

180
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,655
at least let me pick my team.

181
00:07:54,365 --> 00:07:56,155
- Fair enough.
- Good.

182
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,364
- Georgia?
- Mm.

183
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:02,244
You want to move the
entire company to Georgia?

184
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,376
Why?

185
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:05,704
Well, the Valley's become
prohibitively expensive.

186
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,254
Look at these numbers.

187
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:08,874
If we move to Georgia,

188
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,584
we can save a fortune and
get a further investment.

189
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:12,714
It's the only way.

190
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,964
Well, I have heard good things about

191
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,134
the food scene in the Dirty South.

192
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:19,054
Stankonia. Freaknik.

193
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:21,301
Might be nice to be around
more people of color.

194
00:08:21,302 --> 00:08:23,644
What? Not Atlanta.

195
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:27,394
Tbilisi. The country of
Georgia, not the state.

196
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:28,605
What?

197
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:31,524
- Gavin?
- Hmm?

198
00:08:31,525 --> 00:08:35,024
Tbilisi is no doubt a
wonderfully rustic place,

199
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:38,364
but do you not fear
losing a local presence,

200
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,954
a connection with the beating heart of

201
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:42,914
the technology industry?

202
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:44,954
Boots on the ground, so to speak.

203
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,125
I think it's wise, sir.

204
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:51,664
Shit. You're right.

205
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,634
I need to be here to
maintain my relevance.

206
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,464
All right then. Plan B.

207
00:08:56,465 --> 00:08:59,764
You two and the team
will move to Belarus.

208
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:03,434
If we can get close enough to
the Chernobyl exclusion zone,

209
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:04,804
it's a buyer's market,

210
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,014
and with the money we
save from substantially

211
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,940
downgrading from Tbilisi,

212
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,422
plus the bigger Belarusian
investment we've been offered,

213
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,814
I'll maintain a
pied-à-terre here in town.

214
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,654
Now, I'll need to rely
much more heavily on you

215
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,324
because you probably won't see me much.

216
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,244
I'll need you to guide the troops

217
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,784
and bridge the language gap,

218
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:24,454
but...

219
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:26,414
God damn,

220
00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:28,955
I respect the hell out of you both.

221
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,964
- Are you sure about this?
- Uh...

222
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:41,464
Yeah. Yeah, no.

223
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:44,804
We can't have that atrocious
game anywhere on our network.

224
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:46,434
- We have to do a raise.
- Well,

225
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:49,145
it's a terrible time to do it, but...

226
00:09:49,975 --> 00:09:51,474
I mean, it's your call.

227
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:53,314
It's gonna have to be
a big number though.

228
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,694
Yeah, good.

229
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,854
I guess we should set
up some meetings, yeah?

230
00:09:56,855 --> 00:10:00,115
Too time-consuming.
Let's jump-start the process.

231
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:02,904
Are you feeling charitable?

232
00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,414
Just 39 cents a day can literally

233
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,874
feed an entire family like this.

234
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,084
Think about it, then ask yourself...

235
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:17,069
All right, so this place
is the who's who of VCs,

236
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,004
so let's do a lap, take inventory,

237
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:22,094
and we'll start with the biggest
firm, work our way down to...

238
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:24,844
- Laurie!
- Monica. Richard.

239
00:10:24,845 --> 00:10:26,555
What are you doing here?

240
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:29,354
The same as you, I suppose.

241
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:31,564
Eating caviar and...

242
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,774
hacking famine.

243
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:36,354
- No, I thought you moved to China.
- Mm.

244
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:38,904
The interesting thing
about moving, Monica,

245
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,194
is that you can do it
more than once. I am back.

246
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:44,364
You may be intrigued to know

247
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:48,364
that I have severed
ties with Yao and YaoNet.

248
00:10:48,365 --> 00:10:50,164
So, you're going back to VC?

249
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:51,535
Oh, no.

250
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:53,754
You misunderstand.

251
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:57,174
I have severed ties
between Yao and YaoNet.

252
00:10:57,175 --> 00:10:59,424
Yao has been exited,
and I have made myself

253
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,674
the CEO of the company,

254
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,964
which I am moving back to the US,

255
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,594
and in order to make
it sound more American,

256
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,094
I am renaming it

257
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:09,724
"YaoNetUS".

258
00:11:09,725 --> 00:11:11,934
Wait. So, you're launching here?

259
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,354
Yes, and with those
Chinese out of the way,

260
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:17,064
I can finally be more
ruthlessly efficient.

261
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:18,314
Speaking of,

262
00:11:18,315 --> 00:11:19,905
excuse me.

263
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:24,824
- What? Are you fucking kidding me?
- Richard,

264
00:11:24,825 --> 00:11:27,404
relax, okay, she's got inferior tech,

265
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,248
she's got no developers.
You remember when

266
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,494
she tried to run Eklow? She's
gonna last a week as CEO.

267
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,914
I mean, look at her. She's desperate.

268
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:36,624
She's already in total flirt mode.

269
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:38,504
I do believe with proper management...

270
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:40,254
She needs money just like we do.

271
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,911
Let's just worry about us, okay?

272
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:45,384
I will introduce you, and just...

273
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,514
let me do the talking, okay?

274
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:48,804
Don't speak until...

275
00:11:48,805 --> 00:11:50,514
Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.

276
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,104
- Eric Rivera, Graves Partners.
- Oh.

277
00:11:53,105 --> 00:11:55,144
I saw your congressional testimony,

278
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,604
and I thought, man,

279
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:58,604
I really need to talk to that guy.

280
00:11:58,605 --> 00:12:00,675
Oh, you did? Huh, cool.

281
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:02,404
Yeah. I mean, you committed

282
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,694
to a really bad business model,

283
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,534
on national TV.

284
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:08,114
I guess I just wanted to know,

285
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,744
what the hell were you thinking?

286
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:11,721
I mean, picking a fight
with Facebook is one thing,

287
00:12:11,722 --> 00:12:14,415
but shitting on Google and
Amazon at the same time,

288
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,753
in front of TV cameras? What
was going on in your brain?

289
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,544
And-and Hooli. I-I
shit on them, too, so...

290
00:12:19,545 --> 00:12:21,714
I mean, we're all sitting in
front of the TV in our office,

291
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:24,504
thinking this is the
dumbest man in tech.

292
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:26,689
And then we talked about
it, and we realized, hang on,

293
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,883
- that is totally unfair.
- Yeah, you did? Good.

294
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:31,070
Yeah, because, I mean,
you were subpoenaed, right?

295
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:33,126
You were under oath?
What were you supposed to do?

296
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,514
Technically, I don't...

297
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:36,934
You weren't... you weren't under oath?

298
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:38,394
Mm, I don't think so.

299
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:39,854
Are you kidding me?

300
00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:42,274
Wait. Karl, Ben! Come over
here. You gotta hear this.

301
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:44,814
We were wrong, man! Tell
them what you just told me.

302
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,324
Hey, um...

303
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:52,364
Richard Hendricks, from Pied Piper, yes?

304
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:53,494
Uh, no.

305
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:56,374
Maximo Reyes. I am an
investor from Chile.

306
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,084
Wow, I gotta tell you, it
is an honor to meet you, man.

307
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,874
Truly, I am such a big
fan of your technology.

308
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:03,544
Wow.

309
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:06,505
- What, like, really, or...
- Of course. Hi.

310
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:10,014
We are shaking hands.

311
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,344
Correct?

312
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:13,514
But I'm sure you have more
important people to talk to,

313
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:15,722
you know, and, you have
made it painfully clear

314
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,525
that you do not want
me as an investor, so...

315
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:20,524
No, h-hold on. Wait, I-I-I
made it clear? When did I...

316
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:22,444
Oh no, not you personally,
but I spoke with somebody

317
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:23,854
from your company many times.

318
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,154
Uh, Yarez?

319
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:26,274
Yarez?

320
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,024
Y-Yarez Dun...

321
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,404
Yarez... Oh!

322
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:31,074
- Jared.
- Yes!

323
00:13:31,075 --> 00:13:32,654
- Whatever...
- Potatoes, potatoes.

324
00:13:32,655 --> 00:13:36,374
Well, uh, Yared doesn't really
work with us anymore, so...

325
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,954
- Oh, wow. Well, then.
- Yeah.

326
00:13:38,955 --> 00:13:40,544
Look at you and me.

327
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,504
We are talking.

328
00:13:42,505 --> 00:13:45,044
Have you ever had a Chilean terremoto?

329
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,594
- Denpok, got a minute?
- Yes.

330
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:50,885
I may have a way to
keep us here in the US.

331
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:54,014
Talk.

332
00:13:54,015 --> 00:13:55,895
Are you familiar with CIFIUS?

333
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:57,855
Yes.

334
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:59,604
No.

335
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,484
The Committee on Foreign
Investment in the US,

336
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,024
or CIFIUS,

337
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:07,234
is a federal agency
that has wide latitude

338
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,904
to prevent American companies

339
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:10,404
from doing business with foreigners,

340
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:13,074
if there's a national security threat.

341
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:15,824
Are you familiar with
the dating app Grindr?

342
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,205
No.

343
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,245
Yes.

344
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,584
Last year, CIFIUS reversed the sale

345
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:26,004
of Grindr to Chinese investors.

346
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:29,754
They ruled that the sexual
and HIV status of US citizens

347
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,254
was something they needed to keep

348
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:33,924
out of the hands of foreign interests.

349
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,934
- I understand.
- This morning,

350
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,474
I was on the user database of Foxhole,

351
00:14:38,475 --> 00:14:40,725
when I happened upon a familiar face.

352
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:47,814
Four-star General Hanley Barris.

353
00:14:47,815 --> 00:14:49,774
That is not his face.

354
00:14:49,775 --> 00:14:51,324
No, it is not.

355
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:54,694
But as a four-star general,

356
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:57,244
he could anonymously compel CIFIUS

357
00:14:57,245 --> 00:15:00,454
to prevent Foxhole or its ownership

358
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:01,915
from moving to foreign soil.

359
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:05,164
No more Belarus?

360
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,294
I think General Barris
would be very keen to keep

361
00:15:08,295 --> 00:15:10,794
this type of material
out of the hands of

362
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,214
foreign interests, and by that,

363
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:16,135
I mean his wife, Yekatarina.

364
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:23,814
Hey! What happened to you last night?

365
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:26,984
Oh my God, you reek of booze.

366
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:28,564
Were you out all night?

367
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,155
Monica...

368
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,154
- I got lucky.
- Didn't need to know that.

369
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:36,284
No, no, I got even luckier than that.

370
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:40,114
Tell me, did you know that
the national tree of Chile

371
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,744
is the piñoner?

372
00:15:41,745 --> 00:15:43,244
Also this,

373
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,914
- do you know who Maximo Reyes is?
- Yeah.

374
00:15:45,915 --> 00:15:49,464
The richest man in Chile.
Well, I saw that very tree

375
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,674
in the middle of his living room,

376
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:54,005
and he let me climb it.

377
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:57,674
You met Maximo Reyes

378
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,554
and you went to his house?

379
00:15:59,555 --> 00:16:02,014
Yeah, and he showed
me his art collection,

380
00:16:02,015 --> 00:16:04,814
and we drank a number of terremotos,

381
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:07,934
which are... fucking disgusting.

382
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,694
Anyway, I may have convinced him

383
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:13,155
to give us enough money

384
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:15,824
to get rid of Colin.

385
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:17,154
Wait, what?

386
00:16:17,155 --> 00:16:19,364
I casually floated 50 million,

387
00:16:19,365 --> 00:16:20,994
and he didn't even bat an eye.

388
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,705
Richard...

389
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,544
There's a reason Jared
tried to ditch this guy.

390
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:29,164
- We cannot take his money.
- Why not?

391
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,874
Did he tell you where he gets it from?

392
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:36,464
How his grandfather was the chief
of secret police under Pinochet?

393
00:16:36,465 --> 00:16:37,804
About how they ran their mines?

394
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,844
They were basically slave traders.

395
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:42,684
He can't really be all that bad.

396
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:46,224
I mean, he really,
really likes Pied Piper.

397
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,474
Look, we cannot take blood money.

398
00:16:48,475 --> 00:16:50,064
You thought selling ads were bad?

399
00:16:50,065 --> 00:16:53,154
These guys executed
people in soccer stadiums.

400
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:55,194
I was open to it at first,

401
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:57,944
but Jared was adamant and he's right.

402
00:16:57,945 --> 00:16:59,413
Fifty million sounds great,

403
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:01,929
but it's an awfully low price
to pay for your integrity.

404
00:17:02,785 --> 00:17:03,954
Fuck.

405
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,244
Look,

406
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:07,204
I know Colin is a sleazebag,

407
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,914
but at least he's temporary.

408
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,044
Okay, Maximo is a thousand times worse,

409
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:12,795
and he would be permanent.

410
00:17:17,175 --> 00:17:18,844
Of course.

411
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,054
He just e-mailed me the term sheet.

412
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,554
I don't even wanna look at him.

413
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:24,434
Just forward it to me.

414
00:17:24,435 --> 00:17:26,685
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

415
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:29,604
I know that this sucks,
but I promise you,

416
00:17:29,605 --> 00:17:31,274
you're doing the right...

417
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,064
Fifty million?

418
00:17:33,065 --> 00:17:35,944
Do you remember when I was offered 10?

419
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,824
Richard.

420
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,485
Hmm?

421
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:42,995
It's not $50 million.

422
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:45,285
Is it more?

423
00:17:46,955 --> 00:17:49,125
It's a billion, Richard.

424
00:17:52,335 --> 00:17:54,375
A what?

425
00:17:54,965 --> 00:17:59,005
He just offered us a
billion dollars for 10%.

426
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,265
Fuck.

427
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,145
You're already holding a cigarette.

428
00:18:11,065 --> 00:18:12,684
Mr. Gilfoyle!

429
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:15,855
- Yes, ma'am?
- Is this your new team?

430
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,484
It is.

431
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,694
Five people, as you requested.

432
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,785
- That man over there?
- Ken.

433
00:18:24,365 --> 00:18:28,074
- Isn't he the coffee guy?
- Barista. Yes.

434
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,994
And Joyce was watering the plants.

435
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:32,504
Mona was working security.

436
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:35,664
Dan and George, they
were painting the lobby.

437
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,834
Until today.

438
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:38,754
Which reminds me,
they all need to change

439
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,924
their LinkedIn status to...

440
00:18:40,925 --> 00:18:43,674
"placaters of middle management".

441
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:46,344
I'll be honest, this is sort of a first.

442
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:48,844
And here you thought I was just...

443
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:50,225
"that guy".

444
00:18:50,815 --> 00:18:52,474
You know, Mr. Gilfoyle, you're right.

445
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:54,064
You're not "that guy",

446
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:57,194
because at the seven companies
I've helped take public,

447
00:18:57,195 --> 00:19:00,234
every other "that guy"
accepted their limitations,

448
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,534
took on a team, and managed
to get their work done.

449
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:04,694
Some of them are now billionaires.

450
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,364
None of them would've gotten into

451
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:08,494
a dick-measuring contest with HR

452
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,204
when they were two weeks behind.

453
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,704
So, lucky us,

454
00:19:11,705 --> 00:19:13,744
I guess you're unique.

455
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:19,044
You know, Gilfoyle, when
I first heard the phrase

456
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,344
"dick-measuring contest",
I thought it was a contest

457
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:23,254
to see who could measure the most dicks.

458
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:24,884
But it isn't,

459
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:26,594
is it, Gilfoyle?

460
00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,344
Is it a typo? Maybe it's a typo.

461
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:31,354
It's not a typo, Richard.
It's spelled out in the offer.

462
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:34,474
One billion dollars, in one lump sum.

463
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,605
Okay, what do I do?

464
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,654
- I don't know.
- Oh. Okay, well,

465
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:43,154
Jared had you pretty convinced
that this was evil money.

466
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,984
It's a billion fucking dollars, Richard!

467
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,574
Okay, so does that make
this less evil or, like,

468
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,414
- way more evil?
- Ack!

469
00:19:49,415 --> 00:19:50,784
Do not touch.

470
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:53,534
It's an e-sign. You touch
that button, it's over.

471
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,204
Tell me what to do.

472
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,044
Monica, this is your job!

473
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,045
Look, when my sister

474
00:19:59,046 --> 00:20:01,018
got pregnant her
freshman year of college,

475
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:02,446
I said get an abortion.

476
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:06,384
Well, now my niece, Dakota,
who is very much with us,

477
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:09,094
calls me "Aunt Abortion".

478
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:10,554
I'm sorry.

479
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:13,434
You are the CEO, this is on you.

480
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:15,724
Well, I gotta talk to
Dinesh and Gilfoyle.

481
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,478
No, you can't talk to those animals!

482
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,442
You say a word to anyone out there,

483
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:22,984
and this whole company turns into
Lord of the Flies in five seconds.

484
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:25,485
It's a billion dollars, Richard.

485
00:20:26,075 --> 00:20:27,654
I'm sorry. You're on your own.

486
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:29,115
Monica...

487
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:32,744
Richard, there is a major emergency.

488
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:35,436
Gilfoyle is using the
barista as one of the coders,

489
00:20:35,437 --> 00:20:37,760
so I tried to use the
cappuccino machine on my own,

490
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:40,374
and I don't know if, like,
the frother knob is, like,

491
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,754
jammed or something,

492
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:43,464
but it's, like, not working.

493
00:20:43,465 --> 00:20:45,634
So, there is no froth,

494
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,995
at all, for anybody.

495
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:51,224
So, can you get on that?

496
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:53,144
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

497
00:20:53,145 --> 00:20:54,934
He's on it!

498
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:58,354
It's really a shit sandwich.

499
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,484
They've been in there for a while.

500
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,275
Wonder how it's going.

501
00:21:03,855 --> 00:21:06,025
General Barris. Is it done?

502
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:10,495
- Wonderful.
- Say hello to your wife for me.

503
00:21:11,405 --> 00:21:14,115
Gavin! How was the meeting?

504
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,505
Aah! Fuck!

505
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,594
Richard?

506
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,854
Huh? Yeah.

507
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:39,524
What are you doing here?

508
00:21:39,525 --> 00:21:41,894
Do you have a second?

509
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:44,904
Yeah, yeah. Come on in.

510
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:47,064
I know you tried to
keep Maximo away from me,

511
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:49,694
but one thing lead to
another and-and now this.

512
00:21:49,695 --> 00:21:52,704
- That is quite an offer.
- Yeah.

513
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:55,574
So, what do I do?

514
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,534
Look, Richard, I know you said
Monica's checked out on this,

515
00:21:58,535 --> 00:22:03,533
but... this is kind of a
monumental Pied Piper matter.

516
00:22:03,534 --> 00:22:07,004
I think you should get advice
from somebody within the company.

517
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,384
That's why I'm here, Jared.

518
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:10,424
That's you.

519
00:22:10,425 --> 00:22:12,054
You gotta come back.

520
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:13,884
- Richard...
- I-I know

521
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:16,394
your job changed over time,

522
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,144
but we can undo that.

523
00:22:18,145 --> 00:22:19,564
You know, restructure your role,

524
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,604
move you upstairs so
you're closer to me.

525
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,104
Whatever it takes to make it work.

526
00:22:23,105 --> 00:22:25,234
Come on, think about it. We'll be...

527
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:26,774
a pair of boys, back in business.

528
00:22:26,775 --> 00:22:29,574
Richard, it's too late. I mean,

529
00:22:29,575 --> 00:22:31,694
you know, you let me go,
so I took the job here

530
00:22:31,695 --> 00:22:33,944
- with Gwart, and...
- So?

531
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:36,914
Go inside and tell Gwart you're leaving.

532
00:22:36,915 --> 00:22:39,074
Well, that's not how loyalty works.

533
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,664
I mean, that wouldn't be fair.

534
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:42,295
Fair?

535
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,755
Years ago, you came to this house,

536
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,794
begging me for a job,
and I gave you one.

537
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,522
In fact, I made you COO. And now,

538
00:22:52,523 --> 00:22:55,014
when I need you the most,
you stab me in the back,

539
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:58,144
and you have the balls to
lecture me about loyalty?

540
00:22:58,145 --> 00:23:00,684
Are you fucking kidding me?

541
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:01,934
I was right.

542
00:23:01,935 --> 00:23:03,815
You are a buddy-fucker.

543
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:07,274
- Please stop saying that.
- Buddy-fucker.

544
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:08,774
Stop saying that.

545
00:23:08,775 --> 00:23:11,407
And-and-and please
just leave this house,

546
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,818
or I can't be held responsible
for my behavior.

547
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:14,902
Oh yeah?

548
00:23:14,903 --> 00:23:16,454
What are you gonna do, Jared? Huh?

549
00:23:16,455 --> 00:23:18,614
You gonna buddy-fuck me?
'Cause that's what you do

550
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:21,374
- to your buddies now, isn't it?
- Get out.

551
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:26,085
Oh, Gwart. No, no, no!
That's too much sun.

552
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:29,465
Oh my God.

553
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:32,254
This is Gwart?

554
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:34,134
Richard...

555
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:36,924
- This is who you're walking away for?
- Richard, do not.

556
00:23:36,925 --> 00:23:38,884
She's your new little code girlfriend?

557
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,264
- Don't.
- This, uh...

558
00:23:41,265 --> 00:23:43,745
- Don't.
- This googly-eyed...

559
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:46,104
- No, no, no, no...
- Yoo-hoo drinking...

560
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:47,644
- No!
- Oh my God.

561
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:50,349
Oh, okay, okay, okay, look, I'm sorry!

562
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,364
- No.
- All right.

563
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:54,030
I oughta knock your teeth,
you bitch-made motherfucker.

564
00:23:54,031 --> 00:23:55,904
I-I-I... I didn't mean it.

565
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:57,244
I was state-raised!

566
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,034
You think I'm scared to catch a case

567
00:23:59,035 --> 00:24:01,244
- of some bullshit?!
- I-I'm sorry, Jared!

568
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:03,477
I didn't mean it, okay? I'm
sorry, Gwart. I didn't mean it!

569
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,584
You keep her name out of
your skanky little mouth,

570
00:24:05,585 --> 00:24:07,164
you little, little bitch!

571
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:09,874
Hey! Hey! Hey! This is
a place of business...

572
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,424
Oh my God. Don't shoot me!

573
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:12,844
Jared!

574
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:15,674
- Jared! Aah!
- Dope-led, peckerwood motherfucker!

575
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:18,474
- Jared! Jared, no!
- Get checked in, hoe!

576
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:22,344
Oh, Jesus!

577
00:24:22,345 --> 00:24:25,684
You wanna dance on the blacktop, homie?!

578
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:27,855
You did this, Richard!

579
00:24:29,025 --> 00:24:30,604
Aah!

580
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:32,354
Ow, what the fuck?

581
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:39,324
Mr. Gilfoyle! You wanted
to see me before I left?

582
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:41,614
Yes, Tracy, I did.

583
00:24:41,615 --> 00:24:45,414
I wanted you to be here when I
push my entire backlog of code.

584
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:49,044
You finished all of
it? In just 24 hours?

585
00:24:49,045 --> 00:24:52,045
I did, all by myself.

586
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,964
I'll take that apology now.

587
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:02,094
Mr. Gilfoyle, you said
that I had to choose.

588
00:25:02,095 --> 00:25:05,224
You said I could have it
fast or I could have it right,

589
00:25:05,225 --> 00:25:08,434
but I just got it fast and right,

590
00:25:08,435 --> 00:25:10,854
and all I had to do was
threaten your manhood

591
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:12,774
by assigning you other coders.

592
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:14,654
It worked at seven other companies,

593
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:16,865
and it obviously worked here.

594
00:25:17,405 --> 00:25:19,404
We're back on schedule!

595
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:21,244
Now, why would I be sorry about that.

596
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,535
I respect your skills.

597
00:25:27,245 --> 00:25:28,374
Thank you.

598
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,455
See you in the morning.

599
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:36,084
And now, we are both holding

600
00:25:36,085 --> 00:25:37,634
- a whiskey.
- Yes.

601
00:25:37,635 --> 00:25:40,108
Um, Maximo, I wanna apologize

602
00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:41,712
for coming over here unannounced.

603
00:25:41,713 --> 00:25:43,689
And I wanna do this deal with you,

604
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,264
but... Jesus...

605
00:25:45,265 --> 00:25:48,144
Richard, you have some
concerns because of my family.

606
00:25:48,145 --> 00:25:49,645
I mean... yeah.

607
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:52,644
Richard, do you see these photographs?

608
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:55,904
Now, these people, a
lot of them children,

609
00:25:55,905 --> 00:25:58,774
used to work for my father
in my family's mines.

610
00:25:58,775 --> 00:26:00,654
Now, I keep them here as a reminder

611
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,784
of the many, many
mistakes my father made.

612
00:26:02,785 --> 00:26:05,704
I want to fix those mistakes, Richard.

613
00:26:05,705 --> 00:26:08,164
By investing in you and your company,

614
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,744
I'll be able to start doing that.

615
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:11,124
Do you really believe that?

616
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,504
Richard, we are going to
change the world, you and I.

617
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:16,544
Shit! What was that?

618
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:19,464
Ah, the birds. You know,
they're attracted to the tree,

619
00:26:19,465 --> 00:26:21,054
so sometimes, you know, kapffft!

620
00:26:21,055 --> 00:26:22,885
What are you gonna do?

621
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:26,974
- To rectifying the mistakes of my father.
- Sure. Yeah.

622
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:29,580
The fool who allowed
the workers to unionize

623
00:26:29,581 --> 00:26:31,014
and ask for higher wages

624
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,064
and more expensive hospitals.

625
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:35,564
- We...
- Uh, sorry. What was that?

626
00:26:35,565 --> 00:26:37,814
Yes. My grandfather, he
built a great fortune,

627
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:40,614
but then my idiot father
almost gave it all away.

628
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:42,824
But not now, though. Oh no.

629
00:26:42,825 --> 00:26:45,704
Now, I mine copper, cobalt and diamonds,

630
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,824
and now, thanks to you,

631
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,835
data. Gracias.

632
00:26:51,035 --> 00:26:53,004
Uh, no. No, what?

633
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:55,044
No, we do not...

634
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:56,294
Oh my God!

635
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:57,674
Uh...

636
00:26:57,675 --> 00:26:59,174
No, we...

637
00:26:59,175 --> 00:27:02,304
We will not mine user data.

638
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:03,844
I was very clear about that.

639
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:05,411
But you do.

640
00:27:05,412 --> 00:27:06,645
Richard, did you not tell me

641
00:27:06,646 --> 00:27:08,934
when we were sitting
on my tree, bonding,

642
00:27:08,935 --> 00:27:11,106
that there is a man in
your network right now,

643
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:14,024
using a tool, that you built,
in order to mine user data?

644
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,604
No. That is coming to an end.
That doesn't happen anymore.

645
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:19,734
Richard, please. Cheers.

646
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:21,364
To our future endeavors together.

647
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:22,734
Maximo...

648
00:27:22,735 --> 00:27:26,404
we will never collect
and monetize user data.

649
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:27,864
Ever.

650
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:31,374
Then why would I give you
one billion dollars, Richard?

651
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:34,084
Look at me. I am not
a fool like my father.

652
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:39,044
You are turning this into
a dick-measuring contest.

653
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:42,174
Please don't, because I assure you,

654
00:27:42,175 --> 00:27:45,385
it will be I who measures the most.

655
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:48,384
Are-are you threatening me?

656
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:49,724
Take my money, Richard.

657
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,104
It'll be very good for you,

658
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:53,474
and very good for me.

659
00:27:53,475 --> 00:27:57,064
But if you do not take
my money, Richard...

660
00:27:57,065 --> 00:28:00,065
oh, it will be very bad for you.

661
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:23,734
Richard, it's Maximo.

662
00:29:23,735 --> 00:29:25,314
We are on the phone.

663
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:27,989
Let me tell you what is
going to happen to you next.

664
00:29:30,155 --> 00:29:32,904
All I wanted to do was
be a golden millionaire.

665
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,324
A millionaire that gets peed on?

666
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:37,334
I could see you making half that happen.

667
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:39,244
Can I be honest with you for once?

668
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,294
For once? You're my attorney.

669
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:42,418
You're out of options.

670
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,584
- Holy shit.
- We could buy Hooli.

671
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:45,795
Take your marks.

672
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:54,748
I still got it, Hoover.

673
